Homebrewing: How to Make Your Own Beer
Fill your brew pot two-thirds full of cool water and place it on the stove, with the burner set on medium-high.
Heat the thick, syrupy malt extract to make it less viscous and easier to scoop out of the can (or squeeze out of the bag).
Open the can or bag, scrape all the extract into the brew pot, and use your virgin brew spoon to give the mix a vigorous stir.
Set a timer or note the time when you poured extract into the brew pot.
Boil uncovered for 1 hour, stirring regularly and keeping the brew pot at a slow, rolling boil.
Add your hops to the brew pot according to your recipe.
While the extract is boiling, sanitize the equipment you need for fermentation.
After half an hour has elapsed, remove and rinse the various pieces of sanitized equipment.
When 1 hour has elapsed since you poured in the extract, turn off the burner and now place the lid on the brew pot.
Cool the wort (after it’s mixed with water, the boiled extract is transformed into wort).
While the wort is cooling, fill your sanitized cup or bowl with lukewarm water (approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit, 27 degrees Celsius), tear open the yeast packet, and sprinkle the yeast into the water.
When the brew pot is cool to the touch, carefully pour the cooled wort into the sanitized fermenter.
Top up the fermenter to the 5-gallon line with cold bottled water (or tap water, if yours is of acceptable quality).
Take a hydrometer reading (optional).
Pour the yeast into the cooled wort to start the fermentation process.
Close the fermenter with its lid, leaving the airlock or bubbler out, and place the fermenter in a cool, dark location, such as a basement, crawl space, or closet.
When the fermenter is in place, attach the rubber stopper to the airlock, fill it halfway with water, and snap on the airlock cap; then position the airlock (bubbler) securely into the hole in the fermenter lid.
Wait seven or eight days.
