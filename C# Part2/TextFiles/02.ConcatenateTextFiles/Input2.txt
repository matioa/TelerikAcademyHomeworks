To say this program has great writing is an understatement. 
BB has the best writing I have ever had the pleasure of listing & reading (I always leave the captioning on). 
The acting is top notch by Cranston. 
It is also very good by Aaron Paul (Pinkman), Dean Norris (Hank), Betsy Brandt (Marie), RJ Mitte (Walt junior). 
Unfortunately, it feels like Anna Gunn (Skyler) is the weak link. 
It is hard to know if the Gilligan is trying to make a somewhat awkward and unlikable character, or if it is just not hitting the mark. 
I prefer to think that the writing is intentionally odd for Skyler for some reason, and that we will get to learn more in the episodes and seasons to come. 
The dialogue is absolutely brilliant for the most part – it almost always rings true. The episodes are gripping (for the most part). 
The story is brutal and comedic at the same time. 
I have to opt for a 10/10 because there is not another program that comes close – even Dexter which I've been enjoying for 5 seasons doesn't have the writing or acting to stand up to BB.
